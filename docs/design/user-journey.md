## Technical Implementation

### Screen Management
- **5 distinct screens** with proper show/hide logic
- **State isolation**: Each screen manages its own elements
- **Smooth transitions**: No jarring changes between states

### Toggle Lock System
```javascript
// During recording
modelToggle.disabled = true
toggleContainer.style.opacity = '0.6'
toggleContainer.style.pointerEvents = 'none'
```

### Minimal Progress System
```javascript
// 3 states only: upcoming, current, done
processSteps.forEach(step => {
    step.setAttribute('data-status', status)
})
```

### Clean Transcript Output
- **New HTML section**: `transcript-output-screen`
- **Metadata population**: Duration, model, corrections count
- **Edit functionality**: Toggle readonly, focus management
- **Action handlers**: Save, export, new recording

## Micro-interactions

### Implemented
- **Toggle lock animation**: Smooth opacity + pointer-events change
- **Progress circles**: Scale + shadow for current state
- **Button hovers**: Subtle color transitions
- **Transcript edit**: Smooth readonly toggle

### Planned
- **Waveform pulse**: More natural audio response
- **Success animations**: Gentle check marks
- **Typing indicators**: During transcript population
- **Save confirmations**: Subtle feedback

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. DOM Errors
- **Issue**: `insertBefore` errors during transcription
- **Solution**: Simplified DOM manipulation, better error handling

### 2. Overcomplicated Progress
- **Issue**: Too many colors, connecting lines, visual noise
- **Solution**: Minimal circles with 3 simple states

### 3. Locked Settings
- **Issue**: Users could change model during recording
- **Solution**: Professional toggle lock with visual feedback

### 4. Poor Output Layout
- **Issue**: Cramped, unprofessional transcript display
- **Solution**: Clean 25/75 layout with proper metadata

### 5. No Flow Continuity
- **Issue**: Abrupt endings, no clear next steps
- **Solution**: "Record new note" button for seamless cycling

## Success Metrics
- **User Confidence**: Settings visually locked during recording
- **Professional Feel**: Clean, medical-grade interface
- **Clear Progress**: Users understand what's happening
- **Easy Editing**: Simple transcript review and modification
- **Seamless Flow**: Natural progression through all 5 stages

## Future Enhancements
- **Audio playback**: Play recorded audio in transcript screen
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick actions for power users
- **Auto-save**: Background saving during editing
- **Export formats**: Multiple output options (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- **Voice commands**: Hands-free operation during recording
