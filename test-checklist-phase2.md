- [x] Recording indicator shows when active
- [ ] Audio level indicator (not yet implemented)

## 3.2 Validate Transcription Accuracy üéØ

### Psychiatric Terminology Tests
- [x] Common medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, etc.) - 100% accuracy
- [x] Dosage formats (mg, milligrams) - normalized correctly
- [ ] Complex medical phrases
- [ ] Multiple speakers (if relevant)
- [ ] Different accents/speaking speeds

### Performance Tests
- [x] Transcription speed (< 1 min for 5 min audio)
- [x] Memory usage during transcription
- [x] CPU usage during transcription
- [ ] Handling of long recordings (>10 minutes)

## 3.3 Test Export Functionality üìÅ

### Export Formats
- [x] Text file export (.txt) - Working
- [ ] PDF export - Not yet implemented (placeholder exists)
- [ ] Copy to clipboard functionality
- [ ] Export with metadata (date, corrections, confidence)

### File Management
- [x] Save dialog works correctly
- [x] Default save location (Documents/DoctorDictate)
- [ ] Auto-save functionality (partially implemented)
- [ ] Version control/backup

## 3.4 Critical Bugs to Check üêõ

### Known Issues
- [ ] PDF export not implemented (only saves as text)
- [ ] Auto-save only logs, doesn't actually save
- [ ] No audio level visualization during recording
- [ ] Templates show error (V1 feature)

### Stability Tests
- [ ] App doesn't crash on invalid audio input
- [ ] Handles network disconnection gracefully (shouldn't matter - all local)
- [ ] Recovers from Whisper process failures
- [ ] Handles file permission errors

## 3.5 User Feedback Collection üë•

### Usability Questions
- Is the recording process intuitive?
- Are transcription results accurate enough?
- Is the correction display helpful?
- What features are missing?

### Performance Feedback
- Is transcription speed acceptable?
- Any lag or freezing issues?
- Memory/battery consumption concerns?

## 3.6 Accuracy Metrics üìä

### Current Results (Synthetic Audio)
- **Word Accuracy**: 69.48% overall
- **Medication Accuracy**: 100% (with corrections)
- **Confidence Score**: 99%
- **Corrections Applied**: Average 2-8 per transcript

### Real-World Testing Needed
- [ ] Test with actual psychiatrist dictation
- [ ] Test with patient interview recordings
- [ ] Test with background noise
- [ ] Test with technical medical discussions

## 3.7 Bug Fixes Needed üîß

### Priority 1 (Critical)
1. Implement actual PDF export functionality
2. Fix auto-save to actually save files
3. Add error recovery for Whisper failures

### Priority 2 (Important)
1. Add audio level visualization
2. Improve progress bar accuracy
3. Add ability to cancel transcription

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
1. Add dark mode support
2. Add keyboard shortcuts
3. Add recent files list
4. Add settings/preferences panel

## Testing Notes

### What's Working Well ‚úÖ
- Whisper integration successful
- Medical dictionary corrections working perfectly
- UI responsive and clean
- Recording functionality stable
- Text export working

### What Needs Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è
- PDF export not implemented
- Auto-save incomplete
- No audio feedback during recording
- Templates trigger error (expected - V1 feature)

## Recommendations for V1
1. Implement encryption for patient data
2. Add proper templates system
3. Enhance medical dictionary with more terms
4. Add batch processing for multiple files
5. Implement user preferences/settings
